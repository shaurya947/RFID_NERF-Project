Watch the final test video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5X8gByMsLI

A project to implement the RFID card reading system in a secure environment-implemented using a PIR motion sensor and a NERF gun.
An arduino board is used to interface all the components. The gun shoots if either an invalid tag is presented to the RFID reader,
or an attempt is made to walk past without presenting the tag.

Developed at the University of Texas at Dallas.
